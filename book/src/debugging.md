# Debugging (DAP)

Mitos has experimental support for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) for setting breakpoints,
stepping through code, and inspecting variables. Install a debug adapter
separately and configure it for the language you want to debug.

## Configure an adapter

Debug adapters are configured per language in
[`languages.toml`](./languages.md#languagestoml-files). Some languages already
have an adapter and launch templates configured. For example, Rust uses
`lldb-dap` by default; its executable must be available on `PATH`.

To configure or override an adapter, add a language entry to your user
`languages.toml`. This example matches the built-in Rust `binary` template:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "rust"

[language.debugger]
name = "lldb-dap"
transport = "stdio"
command = "lldb-dap"

[[language.debugger.templates]]
name = "binary"
request = "launch"
completion = [{ name = "binary", completion = "filename" }]
args = { program = "{0}" }
```

Each template defines a `launch` or `attach` request and adapter-specific
arguments. `completion` defines the input prompts; `{0}`, `{1}`, and so on
are replaced with the supplied values. Mitos sets the debug target's `cwd`
to the editor's current working directory.

See the [debugger configuration reference](./configuration.md#languagedebugger)
for TCP transport, attach templates, and the complete list of fields.
Project-local configuration in `.mitos/languages.toml` is subject to
[workspace trust](./workspace-trust.md).

## Start a session

1. Build the program you want to debug, with debug information enabled.
2. Open a source file in Mitos. Its language determines which adapter and
   templates are used.
3. Press `Space G b` on a line to toggle a breakpoint.
4. Press `Space G l`, choose a template, and fill in its prompts.
5. When execution pauses, step through the code or inspect variables using
   the commands below.

`G` is uppercase. Press the keys in sequence. The debug menu stays active
after a command; while it is active, use the suffix keys such as `n` or `c`
directly. Press `Esc` to leave the menu.

You can also start a template from the command line. For a Rust binary built
with `cargo build`, for example:

```text
:debug-start binary target/debug/my-program
```

Replace `my-program` with your executable's name. To connect to an already
running TCP debug adapter, use
`:debug-remote <ip>:<port> <template> [parameters...]`, for example
`:debug-remote 127.0.0.1:4711 binary target/debug/my-program`.

## Debugging commands

These bindings are available in normal and select mode:

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space G l` | Select a template and start debugging |
| `Space G b` | Toggle breakpoints on selected lines |
| `Space G c` | Continue execution |
| `Space G h` | Pause execution |
| `Space G n` | Step over |
| `Space G i` | Step in |
| `Space G o` | Step out |
| `Space G v` | List variables |
| `Space G s t` | Switch thread |
| `Space G s f` | Switch stack frame |
| `Space G r` | Restart the session |
| `Space G t` | End the session |
| `Space G Ctrl-c` | Edit the breakpoint condition on the current line |
| `Space G Ctrl-l` | Edit the breakpoint log message on the current line |
| `Space G e` / `Space G E` | Enable / disable exception breakpoints |

Use `:debug-eval <expression>` to evaluate an expression in the current debug
context. Supported expressions and debugging capabilities depend on the adapter.

## Troubleshooting

- **No debug adapter available for language:** check the current file's
  language and its `[language.debugger]` configuration.
- **Failed to start debug client:** check the adapter's executable path,
  arguments, and transport.
- **No debug config with given name:** use a template name defined in
  `[[language.debugger.templates]]`.
- **Workspace is not trusted:** use `:workspace-trust` to allow debugging in
  a workspace you trust. See [workspace trust](./workspace-trust.md).
